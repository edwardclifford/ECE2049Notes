Introduction to the Course
-------------------------
Embedded Systems - a computer within a product

Hierarchy of Computing:
1. Embedded Controllers
2. PC
3. Mainframe/Server
4. Supercomputer

Characteristics of an Embedded System:
- Performs a small set of tightly coupled functions
- Often larger system that is not a computer
- Must work in real time (often)
- Is a mix of hardware and software

- Not a PC style microprocessor
- Typically used for a special purpose
- Low level but high percentage

- Historically had no operating system, but now can
- Executable code needs to be downloaded from another platform
- SW tailored for HW

What will be learned
- Hardware (architecture)
- CPU, Memory, I/O device organization
- Software (C)
- Learning to use a TI MSP430 microcontroller

There are >300 million PC-style microprocessor units produced in a year
There are 8 billion embedded units produced in that year
They have speed, small size, low power, and are unique
