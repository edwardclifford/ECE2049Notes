More Clocks and Timers
----------------------
MSP430 Clock module is very capable, wide variety of clocking options under software controler
Unified Clock System (UC) --5 possible Clock sources
- XT1CLK
- XT2CLK
- DCOCLK
- VLOCLK
Provides 3 clock signals to CPU and peripherals
On reset they default to the following
(See slide show, know these defaults)

Timers
------
Digital curcuit block that counts clock ticks
Digital circuit that is separate from CPU

Modes
Unidirectionsal mode (Up mode) = count from 0 to a programmer set maximum count
Continuous mode = Counts from 0 to full count of timers (8, 12, or 16 bits)
Yp/Down mode = counts from 0 to max then back to 0

Interrupts
----------
Signal to the CPU from a peripheral or other external sources
- Typically either a request for service from the CPU or a notification that peripheral has something (data) for the CPU
- CPU chooses to accept or ignore interrupts
	- Except non-maskable Interrupts: power faults or oscillator faults
- What will an interrupt from a timer mean?
	- That a fixed amount of time has elapsed

MSP430 - General Purpose Timers
- Timer B
	- Used by Graphics Library
- Timer A0
- Timer A1
- Timer A2
- Basic Timer
- Watchdog Timer
	- When it's on, the WDT must continually have its count reset within the program
	- If the WDT is ON and its count get to 0 it will reboot the MSP430
	- Which is why the first instruction in your main() should be:
	WDTCTL = WDTPW + WDTHOLD;
